# 🕵️ DarkIndex — A Safe and Community-Rated Dark Web Search Engine

**DarkIndex** is an open-source search engine designed for the dark web (.onion sites).  
It focuses on **privacy**, **security**, and **community-driven content rating**, to help users avoid scams, malware, and harmful content.

## 🔐 Why DarkIndex?

- Most dark web search engines are outdated, untrustworthy, or index harmful sites without warnings.
- DarkIndex offers a **clean**, **transparent**, and **user-rated** experience.
- We aim to build a safer way to explore the dark web, without tracking, ads, or hidden scripts.
